# Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

This repository contains the code for my CSE 455 Computer Vision project, which focuses on object detection for autonomous vehicles, fine tuning [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) and [YOLOv4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934) on the [Berkeley DeepDrive Object Detection Task Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04687). The Berkeley DeepDrive Dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/). Code to process the Berkeley DeepDrive Object Detection Task Dataset is in `CV_Data_Processing.ipynb`. To fine tune Faster R-CNN, use `Faster_RCNN.ipynb`.
